# Internship Creative Project

I was chosen to move forward in a "creative project" step towards an internship
Instead of writing an essay, doing a presentation, or making a vision board, I opted for a hands-on demonstration of some simple python skills.
This interactive Python project helps envision what I wish to do, and can contribute to an internship environment.

## How to Use
1. Install Python (if you haven't already).
2. Run the file
3. Enjoy and take it with a slight grain of salt!


## Notes
- This was made for an internship project, feel free to take inspiration!
